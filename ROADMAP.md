# Roadmap

## Implement `ArcGrid` and related classes.

Get these to the point where they can load the actual ARC data.

Give them nice constructors for creating simpler examples by hand.

## Implement the imps for the simplified example ARC world described in the README.

## Implement the simplified example as an end-to-end architectural spike.

## Choose a fairly simple subset of the real ARC tasks and implement that end-to-end.

## Expand in increments to the full ARC task set.
